# face-recognition-based-attendance-system

•	User information such as Name, ID and images are stored by the system as datasets in .JPG files using Name and ID as filename. 
•	When the user is in front of the camera, the system compares datasets and marks attendance, which is generated as an excel file. 
•	The system has 30% accuracy in detecting students' faces facing forward in a classroom. 
•	The face images are represented by a simple data vector using the LBP algorithm and histograms, and this algorithm gives the system 20% accuracy in its functionality.
